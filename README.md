# README

Hello, this is MyWeb project where I am making a template website.
You can look for more information in my Github wiki pages.

The current directory you are in is for the administration pages.
It means this folder contains later a page where you add posts and other things to your website.

In View directory is the visible pages that you should show to the web.

In Test directory are the tests I will make in this project to make all things needed for the project and reimplement them to the project website.

This repository doesn't currently contain my test files that I use in Robot Framework or Testlink.
